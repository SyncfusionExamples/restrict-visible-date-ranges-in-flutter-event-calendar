# How to restrict the visible date ranges in the Flutter Calendar?

A quick-start example to help you to restrict the visible date ranges in the Flutter Calendar.

You can restrict the visible date ranges in the Flutter Event Calendar by using the calendar's [minDate](https://pub.dev/documentation/syncfusion_flutter_calendar/latest/calendar/SfCalendar/minDate.html) and [maxDate](https://pub.dev/documentation/syncfusion_flutter_calendar/latest/calendar/SfCalendar/maxDate.html) properties. It is applicable in all the schedule views.

When the minDate and maxDate are set to the calendar, you cannot swipe the control using touch gesture beyond those dates.
